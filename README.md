# Titan CCP - Deployment

The [Titan Control Center Prototype](http://eprints.uni-kiel.de/43910) (CCP) is a
scalable monitoring infrastructure for [Industrial DevOps](https://industrial-devops.org/).
It allows to monitor, analyze and visualize the electrical power consumption of
devices and machines in production environments such as factories.

This repository contains declarations for deploying the Titan CCP on a Kubernetes
cluster or with Docker Compose.
