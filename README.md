# Titan Control Center

The [Titan Control Center](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8822045)
is a scalable monitoring infrastructure for [Industrial DevOps](https://industrial-devops.org/).
It allows to monitor, analyze and visualize the electrical power consumption of
devices and machines in industrial production environments.

The Titan Control Center is designed in a microservice-based architecture augmented by big data
and stream processing techniques. The individual software components are located in separate
Git repositories:

* **[History](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-history)** The *History* microservice
* **[Aggregation](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-aggregation)** The *Aggregation* microservice
* **[Statistics](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-stats)** The *Statistics* microservice
* **[Sensor Management](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-sensor-management)** The *Sensor Management* microservice
* **[Visualization](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-frontend)** Web-based *Visualization* and the corresponding backend
* **[Record Bridge](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-record-bridge)** The *Record Bridge* framework, microservices and related projects
* **[Common](https://github.com/cau-se/titan-ccp-common)** Library code and record definitions to be used by all microservices

## Titan Control Center - Deployment

This repository contains declarations for deploying the Titan Control Center with [Docker Compose](docker-compose)
or in a [cloud environment operated by Kubernetes](kubernetes).
